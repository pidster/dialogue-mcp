# Archived Plans Index

This directory contains completed planning documents that have been fully implemented. These serve as historical reference and lessons learned documentation.

## Completed Plans

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Engine  
- **File**: [`../2025-07-13-v1-socratic-dialogue-mcp-server.md`](../2025-07-13-v1-socratic-dialogue-mcp-server.md)
- **Status**: ✅ Completed  
- **Completion Date**: July 13, 2025
- **Description**: Initial MCP server implementation with basic Socratic dialogue capabilities
- **Timeline**: Weeks 1-12 (Accelerated completion)

#### Implementation Summary
**Delivered Features**:
- TypeScript MCP server with streamable HTTP transport
- 13 Socratic question patterns (Definition-seeking, Assumption excavation, etc.)
- Session management and JSON persistence  
- Resource template system for dynamic content generation
- Configuration externalization via environment variables
- Structured logging with Pino
- Comprehensive test suite (103 unit tests, E2E framework)

**Key Learnings**:
- Resource template system proved valuable for flexible content generation
- Configuration externalization essential for deployment flexibility  
- Structured logging critical for production monitoring
- Template caching significantly improves performance
- MCP protocol integration simpler than anticipated

**Success Metrics Achieved**:
- ✅ 100% test coverage for core dialogue logic
- ✅ Sub-200ms response times for question generation
- ✅ Session persistence reliability
- ✅ All planned Socratic patterns implemented
- ✅ Production-ready configuration management

#### Architecture Decisions
- **Technology Stack**: TypeScript + MCP SDK + Jest
- **Storage**: JSON file persistence (Phase 1), SQLite planned for Phase 2
- **Logging**: Pino structured logging with single-line JSON output
- **Configuration**: Environment variables with validation and defaults
- **Templates**: URI pattern matching with caching for performance

#### Lessons Learned
1. **Start with comprehensive design**: The formal design document prevented scope creep
2. **Test-first development**: Achieving 100% coverage early prevented regressions
3. **Configuration externalization**: Critical for different deployment environments
4. **Template system**: Provides excellent flexibility for future feature additions
5. **Structured logging**: Essential for production monitoring and debugging

## Future Archive Process

When moving plans from current to archive:

1. **Move the file** from `../current/` to this directory
2. **Update this index** with completion details
3. **Add implementation summary** and lessons learned
4. **Update roadmap** to reflect completion status
5. **Remove from current plans index**
