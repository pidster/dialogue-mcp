## Plan Creation Workflow

When creating new plans in this directory:

1. **Use proper naming convention**: `{year-month-day}-{version}-{topic}.md`
2. **Include required sections**:
   - Project overview and scope
   - Technical architecture and design
   - Implementation phases and timeline
   - Data models and interfaces
   - Success metrics and quality gates
   - Risk assessment and mitigation
   - Testing strategy
   - Dependencies and integration points

3. **Link to roadmap**: Update [`../roadmap.md`](../roadmap.md) with plan references
4. **Update this index**: Add new plan to the active list above
5. **Create Mermaid diagrams**: Include formal system diagrams per engineering practices

## Active Development Notes

### Current Sprint Focus
- **Week of July 13, 2025**: Establishing planning infrastructure and roadmap
- **Next Sprint**: Begin Phase 2 planning - decision tracking system design

### Immediate Priorities
1. Complete roadmap documentation
2. Create Phase 2 detailed implementation plan
3. Begin technical design for decision tracking service
4. Define knowledge graph data structures
