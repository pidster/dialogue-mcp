# Refactoring Plans Index

This directory contains technical debt remediation plans, performance optimization strategies, and architectural improvements that enhance system quality without adding new features.

## Active Refactoring Plans

*No active refactoring plans currently identified.*

## Potential Refactoring Areas

Based on the current codebase analysis, the following areas may require future refactoring attention:

### Performance Optimizations
- **Session Storage**: Migrate from JSON files to SQLite for better concurrent access
- **Template Caching**: Implement distributed caching for multi-instance deployments  
- **Knowledge Graph**: Optimize graph traversal algorithms for large datasets
- **Memory Management**: Implement session cleanup and garbage collection

### Code Quality Improvements  
- **Type Safety**: Strengthen TypeScript strict mode compliance
- **Error Handling**: Standardize error handling patterns across modules
- **Testing**: Increase integration test coverage beyond current unit tests
- **Documentation**: Add comprehensive API documentation with examples

### Architectural Enhancements
- **Modular Design**: Extract dialogue patterns into pluggable modules
- **Configuration**: Enhance configuration validation and type safety
- **Logging**: Implement log level configuration and structured metadata
- **Security**: Add authentication and authorization framework

### Technical Debt
- **Dependencies**: Regular security updates and version maintenance
- **Build Process**: Optimize build pipeline and bundle size
- **Database**: Plan migration strategy from JSON to SQLite
- **Monitoring**: Implement health checks and metrics collection

## Refactoring Workflow

When creating refactoring plans:

1. **Identify the Problem**: Document performance bottlenecks, code smells, or technical debt
2. **Assess Impact**: Evaluate risk, effort, and business value
3. **Create Plan**: Follow standard plan template with:
   - Current state analysis
   - Target state design  
   - Migration strategy
   - Risk mitigation
   - Testing approach
   - Rollback procedures

4. **Schedule Work**: Integrate with roadmap and feature development
5. **Execute Incrementally**: Plan for minimal disruption to ongoing development

## Quality Gates

All refactoring work must maintain:
- **Zero Regression**: All existing tests must continue passing
- **Performance**: No degradation in existing metrics
- **API Compatibility**: No breaking changes to public interfaces  
- **Documentation**: Updated to reflect changes
- **Test Coverage**: Maintained or improved coverage levels

## Monitoring Technical Debt

### Code Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: Currently 100% for unit tests, monitor for degradation
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Target < 10 for all functions
- **Code Duplication**: Monitor for DRY principle violations
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular dependency scanning

### Performance Metrics  
- **Response Time**: < 200ms for question generation
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor for memory leaks in long-running sessions
- **Database Performance**: Query time monitoring as data grows
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Template cache effectiveness tracking

### Technical Debt Indicators
- **Build Time**: Monitor for degradation as codebase grows
- **Test Execution Time**: Keep test suite fast for development velocity
- **Dependencies**: Track outdated packages and security updates
- **Documentation Gaps**: Monitor API documentation coverage

## Integration with Development

### Refactoring Schedule
- **Major Refactoring**: Plan during low-feature development periods
- **Minor Improvements**: Integrate with regular feature development
- **Critical Fixes**: Address immediately as they're discovered
- **Dependency Updates**: Regular monthly maintenance windows

### Risk Management
- **Backup Strategy**: Ensure rollback capabilities for all changes
- **Staged Deployment**: Test refactoring in non-production environments
- **Monitoring**: Enhanced monitoring during refactoring periods
- **Communication**: Clear stakeholder communication about changes
