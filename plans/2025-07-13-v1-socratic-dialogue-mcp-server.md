# Socratic Dialogue MCP Server Implementation Plan

**Date**: July 13, 2025  
**Version**: v1  
**Topic**: Socratic Dialogue MCP Server  

## Project Overview

Building an MCP server that provides LLM clients with Socratic dialogue capabilities for problem-solving and decision tracking. The system will help refine approaches to designing, implementing, and reviewing code through structured dialogue inspired by Socrates.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Socratic Dialogue Engine
- **Question Pattern Library**: 10 types of Socratic questioning patterns
  - Definition-seeking, assumption excavation, consistency testing
  - Concrete instantiation, necessity testing, conceptual clarity
  - Epistemic humility, solution space mapping, impact analysis, value clarification
- **Adaptive Questioning**: Context-aware question selection based on expertise and project phase
- **Response Analysis**: Parse user responses to extract insights and update knowledge

### 2. Decision Tracking Service  
- **Decision States**: to-be-made → provisional → firm → superseded
- **Decision Relationships**: Track how decisions connect, impact, and relate to each other
- **Consistency Checking**: Detect contradictions and conflicts in decision chains
- **Knowledge Graph**: Maintain graph of assumptions, definitions, requirements, constraints, decisions

### 3. MCP Integration
- **Tools**: Expose decision CRUD operations, dialogue management
- **Resources**: Provide access to question patterns, session context
- **File System Access**: Read project files for context enhancement
- **Session Management**: Persistent dialogue state across interactions

## Technical Architecture

### Core Stack
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **MCP Framework**: Official MCP SDK
- **Storage**: In-memory with JSON persistence (Phase 1), SQLite (Phase 2+)
- **Knowledge Graph**: Custom implementation using adjacency lists
- **Testing**: Jest for unit and integration tests

- [ ] Initial question pattern library

#### Week 3-4: Core Dialogue Engine
- [ ] Question selector logic
- [ ] Basic decision tracking with status transitions
- [ ] Simple knowledge graph structure
- [ ] Session persistence (JSON files)

### Phase 2: Intelligence & Integration (Weeks 5-8)
**Deliverable**: Intelligent system with adaptive questioning and contradiction detection

#### Week 5-6: MCP Capabilities
- [ ] File system access for project context
- [ ] Repository integration capabilities
- [ ] Context analysis and enrichment
- [ ] Enhanced domain knowledge integration

#### Week 7-8: Advanced Features
- [ ] Contradiction detection algorithms
- [ ] Adaptive questioning based on context
- [ ] Response analysis and insight extraction
- [ ] Knowledge graph relationship mapping

### Phase 3: Polish & Testing (Weeks 9-12)
**Deliverable**: Production-ready service with full feature set

#### Week 9-10: User Experience
- [ ] Rich CLI interface for dialogue
- [ ] Visual knowledge graph exports
- [ ] Session management UI
- [ ] Documentation and examples

#### Week 11-12: Quality & Testing
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] Documentation completion

## Data Models

### Decision Model
```typescript
interface Decision {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  status: 'to-be-made' | 'provisional' | 'firm' | 'superseded';
  context: string;
  rationale?: string;
  alternatives?: string[];
  impacts: string[];
  relationships: DecisionRelationship[];
  timestamp: Date;
  sessionId: string;
}
```

### Question Pattern Model
```typescript
interface QuestionPattern {
  id: string;
  type: SocraticPatternType;
  template: string;
  context: string[];
  followUpTriggers: string[];
  expectedInsights: string[];
}
```

### Knowledge Graph Node
```typescript
interface KnowledgeNode {
  id: string;
  type: 'assumption' | 'definition' | 'requirement' | 'constraint' | 'decision' | 'contradiction';
  content: string;
  relationships: NodeRelationship[];
  sessionId: string;
  confidence: number;
}
```

## Success Metrics

1. **Depth of Inquiry**: Average questions to reach foundational assumptions
2. **Insight Quality**: User ratings of discovered insights  
3. **Assumption Discovery**: Count of implicit assumptions made explicit
4. **Contradiction Detection**: Accuracy of conflict identification
5. **Decision Tracking**: Completeness of decision relationship mapping

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------------|
| Over-questioning | Implement depth limits and progress indicators |
| Context Loss | Robust session state management with persistence |
| User Frustration | Clear value demonstrations and intuitive interface |
| Integration Complexity | Start minimal, expand gradually with user feedback |
| Performance Issues | Optimize knowledge graph operations and caching |

## Next Steps

1. **Begin Phase 1**: Set up TypeScript project structure
2. **Design Data Models**: Create comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
3. **Implement Core Engine**: Basic question patterns and decision tracking
4. **User Testing**: Early feedback on dialogue quality and effectiveness
5. **Iterate**: Refine based on real-world usage patterns
