## File Naming Convention

All plan files follow the format: `{year-month-day}-{version}-{subject-of-plan}.md`

**Examples**:
- `2025-07-13-v1-socratic-dialogue-mcp-server.md`
- `2025-07-20-v2-decision-tracking.md` 
- `2025-08-01-v3-external-integrations.md`

## Plan Categories

### Current Plans (`current/`)
Active planning documents for features currently in development or next to be developed. These represent the immediate roadmap items and should be actively maintained.

### Archived Plans (`archive/`)
Completed planning documents that have been fully implemented. These serve as historical reference and lessons learned documentation.

### Refactoring Plans (`refactoring/`)
Technical debt remediation plans, performance optimization strategies, and architectural improvements that don't add new features but improve system quality.

## Plan Maintenance Guidelines

### Adding New Plans
1. Create plan document using naming convention
2. Add to appropriate subdirectory (`current/`, `archive/`, `refactoring/`)
3. Update relevant README.md index
4. Link from roadmap if applicable

### Completing Plans  
1. Move completed plan from `current/` to `archive/`
2. Update both directory indexes
3. Update roadmap status
4. Create follow-up plans if needed

### Updating Plans
1. Plans in `current/` should be actively maintained
2. Update roadmap when timelines or scope change
3. Archive old versions when major revisions occur
4. Maintain change log in plan documents

## Integration with Development

### Workflow Integration
- Plans should be referenced in commit messages
- Feature branches should link to planning documents  
- Pull requests should validate against plan requirements
- Issues should reference relevant planning documents

### Success Criteria
Each plan must define:
- Clear deliverables and acceptance criteria
- Timeline and milestones
- Success metrics and quality gates
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Dependencies and blockers
