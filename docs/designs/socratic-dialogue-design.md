        R[Requirements]
        C[Constraints]
        DEC[Decisions]
        CON[Contradictions]
        
        A -.-> R
        D -.-> R
        R -.-> C
        R -.-> DEC
        C -.-> CON
        DEC -.-> CON
    end
```

## Functionality Briefing

- **Output**: Architectural decision records with rationale

#### 3. Requirements Refinement
- **Purpose**: Transform vague requirements into measurable criteria
- **Patterns Used**: Concrete instantiation, contradiction detection
- **Output**: Precise acceptance criteria and priority matrix

#### 4. Implementation Planning
- **Purpose**: Expose planning gaps and validate estimates
- **Patterns Used**: Hypothetical scenarios, consequence tracing
- **Output**: Risk-aware implementation roadmap

#### 5. Code Review Dialogue
- **Purpose**: Question design choices and complexity
- **Patterns Used**: Necessity testing, pattern analysis
- **Output**: Refactoring insights and improvements

### Key Features

    START[User: We need a caching layer]
    Q1[System: What specific performance problem <br/>does the cache solve?]
    A1[User: Database queries are slow]
    Q2[System: Which queries specifically? <br/>Can you show me metrics?]
    A2[User: Product search takes 2-3 seconds]
    Q3[System: Why do these queries take 2-3 seconds?]
    A3[User: Complex joins across 5 tables]
    Q4[System: Have you considered query optimisation <br/>before adding architectural complexity?]
    A4[User: No, we assumed caching was needed]
    
    START --> Q1
    Q1 --> A1
    A1 --> Q2
    Q2 --> A2
    A2 --> Q3
    Q3 --> A3
    A3 --> Q4
    Q4 --> A4

```

## Next Steps

1. **Prototype Development**: Begin with Phase 1 core implementation
2. **User Testing**: Recruit 3-5 development teams for early feedback
3. **Pattern Refinement**: Iterate on question patterns based on real usage
4. **Integration Expansion**: Prioritise tool integrations based on user needs
5. **Scale Testing**: Evaluate performance with larger knowledge graphs
